This method returns not null only if context descriptor corresponds to method or function which has receiver 
The result is stored to local variable 
we should generate additional linenumber info after inline call only if it used as argument 
Translates x in a. . in a. . b to a > x | | x > b 
TODO : seems that this method is redundant but it added from safety purposes before new milestone 
descriptor is null for captured vars 
lambda or callable reference 
marked return could be either non-local or local in case of labeled lambda self-returns 
@param valueParameterCount -1 for property 
@param module @return Continuation < Any ? > type 
NB : similar platform agnostic code in DescriptorUtils.unwrapFakeOverride 
Generates bytecode for entire when expression 
Used via reflection in KotlinCompilerBaseTask 
Useful main for derived command line tools 
TODO : includeRuntime should be not a flag but a path to runtime

Expression type should be taken from EXPRESSION_TYPE_INFO slice 
Returns a set of enum or sealed types of which supertypeOwner is an entry or a member 
Visits function call arguments and determines data flow information changes 
Determines whether receiver argument or this object is substituted for explicit receiver 
The result of mapping the value argument to a parameter

Leaf expressions never need to be parenthesized . 
Creates or retrieves a JsStringLiteral from an interned object pool . 
Returns the parent scope of this scope , or null if this is the root scope . 
We only look at the array expression since the index has its own scope . 
Array literals have their own scoping . 
Functions have their own scoping . 
New constructs bind to the nearest set of parentheses . 
Object literals have their own scope . 
We only look at nodes that would not normally be surrounded by parentheses . 
@param exprs - expressions to add to sequence @return a sequence of expressions . 
Return the next binary digit from the number or -1 if done 
Get the current error reporter . 
Change the current error reporter . @return the previous error reporter 
Controls certain aspects of script semantics . Should be overwritten to alter default behavior . 
Rudimentary support for Design-by-Contract 
Statement block Creates the empty statement block Must make subsequent calls to add statements to the node 
For . . In 
Reconstruct a source line from the buffers . This can be slow ... 
returns the string content . @return non null . 
sets the string content . @param str the new value . Non null . 
Can only be called when node has String context . 
Can only be called when node has String context .

match a NAME ; return null if no match . 
Helper function for toNumber , parseInt , and TokenStream.getToken . 
return and pop the token from the stream if it matches ... otherwise return null 
As defined in ECMA . 
Token errors are reported before tokes is read , so use lastPosition for reporting . 
Get object value assigned with key . @return key object value or null if key is absent 
Get integer value assigned with key . @return key integer value or defaultValue if key is absent 
Return array of present keys 
and enough free space 
Ensure key index creating one if necessary
